# Basic React Workshop

This is a basic React workshop. It is intended to be a quick introduction to React and how to use it. It is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to React. If you are looking for a more comprehensive guide, I recommend the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).
